-- Title: Hello World - http://www.computercraft.info/wiki/Hello_World_Tutorial


-- We can make the computer print "Hello World!" in three different ways.


-- To just print it:
print("Hello World!")


-- write("Hello World!\n")
-- Using \n will make the console go to the next line.
-- (print does this automatically!)
write("Hello World!\n")


-- To print it letter by letter:
textutils.slowPrint("Hello World!")



-- Try to switch the order of the code, does everything still works?
